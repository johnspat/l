# Interview Task for PERL

## The job

For this job, you will be conducting a lot of exploratory analysis of data sets containing different kinds of information about students. This interview task is meant to give you a sense of what that will look like and to see what you can do with a small set of data.

## The Task

In this repository, you will find a data file (data.csv) containing student grades in a course and SAT scores. The students are labeled by the college in which they are enrolled. Your job is to analyze this data using a Jupyter notebook to determine what you can about the data set.

Once you have completed this task, commit your changes to your repository and send me an email (caballero@pa.msu.edu) that you have done so. I ask that you complete this task by 5pm on Friday, February 7th.
